## Hi I'm Justin 

### About Me 

<b> Career and What I am doing: </b> <br>
  I am Junior Developer currently working as a Code Coach, Course Designer and Student Manager at CodeSpace Academy.

<b> Academics: </b> <br>
  I studied a Diploma in Applications Development at Cape Peninsula University of Technology and the career path that I want to pursue in Tech is that of a Systems Developer, Senior Developer or Project Manager.

  The main reason for me wanting to pursue this type of role for my future career is because of how I learnt to solve and create software solutions during University. I also enjoy the logical and problem solving aspect involved with Systems design.
