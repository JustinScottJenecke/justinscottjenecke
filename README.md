## üí™ About Me 

<b> Career and What I am doing: </b> <br>
- I am currently working as at **CodeSpace Academy** a **Code Coach** where I support and validate the learning of juniors taking their first steps towards a career in tech, and I am also a **Course Designer** where I work on curriculum updates, edits, and refactors.

<b> Academics: </b> <br>
- I studied a Diploma in Applications Development at Cape Peninsula University of Technology and the career path that I want to pursue in Tech is that of an Application Developer in the enterprise or web development space.

<b> Current Plans: </b> <br>
- Some of the technologies I am playing around include ASP .Net Core since I think the ecosystem, tooling, and community around C# are very good.
- I am also learning significantly more about JavaScript thanks to the tech stack we use at CodeSpace, and I am exploring frameworks other than Vue to increase long-term career prospects.
