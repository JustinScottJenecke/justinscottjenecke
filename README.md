## Hi I'm Justin 

### Junior Developer currently working as a Code Coach, Course Designer and Student Manager at CodeSpace Academy.

<b> About Me </b>
I studied a Diploma in Applications Development at Cape Peninsula University of Technology and the career path that I want to pursue in Tech is that of a Systems Developer or Senior Developer.
The main reason for me wanting to pursue this type of role for my future career is because of how I learnt to solve and create software solutions during University, the role I played in most of my Uni and personal projects, and finally becuase I enjoy the logical and problem solving aspect involved with Systems design.
